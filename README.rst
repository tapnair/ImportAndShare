Import And Share
================
Demo Addin to import STEP files and create public share links.

.. image:: resources/readMeCover.png

This sample application makes use of the new Data Event
that is fired when the cloud data (DataFile) is available
for a newly saved (or imported) Fusion 360 Document.

Usage
-----
Run the app.

Click the Icon on the Utilities Tab in the Add-ins Panel

You will be prompted to select a directory

All STEP files in this directory will be imported to the active project and a share link will be created.

The resulting Public-Share-links and Version ID's will be stored in a csv file in this directory called output.csv


Installation
------------
- `Download or clone the latest version <https://github.com/tapnair/ImportAndShare/archive/refs/heads/master.zip>`_
- Unzip the archive to a permanent location on your computer
- It is important that the directory be named *ImportAndShare*.

*Note: If you are downloading the zip file from github it typically appends -master to the folder name.
You must rename the folder for Fusion 360 to recognize the addin.*

After you download and extract the zip file:

1.	Open the scripts and add-ins dialog box
2.	Select the add-ins tab in the top of the dialog
3.	Click the little green plus button to add the add-in
4.	Select the directory named Export2D and click the open button
5.	With it selected click the run button at the bottom of the dialog

Sample Scripts
--------------

You can follow the same procedure, but on the Scripts tab to run one of the smaller sample scripts
as opposed to the Add-in.

These scripts demonstrate smaller pieces of the functionality in a more isolated way.

ImportDirectoryScript
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This will import all STEP files in the selected directory and leave them open

CreateShareLinksScript
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This will create share links for all open documents and then close them if the cloud data is ready.

ImportAndShareScript
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This will perform the import, create share link, and close the files.
The main difference here is that it does not create a command icon and is not using the full Add-in Framework.
It does show the implementation of an Event Handler to react when the imported files are ready for processing.

Other Use Cases
---------------
`See here for an interesting fork of this repo that also publishes the data to airtable <https://github.com/IronicMango/ImportAndShare>`_
